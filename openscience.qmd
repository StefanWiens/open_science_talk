## open science

A collection of values, practices and movements aiming to

-   make scientific processes more **transparent** and their

-   results more **accessible** [@spellman2018]

## transparency

-   shows all steps of the scientific process
-   provides details of study process
-   avoids filtering by results
    -   research flexibility
    -   publication bias

. . .

## accessibility

-   preregistration
-   material
-   data
-   analysis scripts
-   preprint

## preregistration

-   research recipe
-   reduce research flexibility
-   check feasibility before collecting data
-   save time and effort
-   [OSF](https://osf.io/) (Open science framework)
    -   [own example](https://osf.io/psrjf)
-   Registered Report
    -   preregistration with a journal
    -   in-principle acceptance

## sharing data/material

-   data reuse: study as data-point in a future meta-analysis [@lakens2016]
-   consider ethics/waste in **not** sharing

. . .

-   plan ahead for data sharing ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/))
-   data storage
    -   [SUB support](https://www.su.se/staff/researchers/research-data/manage-store-data)
    -   [figshare Stefan project](https://su.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Open_data_Electrophysiological_correlates_of_in-vivo_and_virtual_reality_therapy_in_spider_phobia/14891607)

## data sharing and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

-   personal data are data that can be attributed to a living natural person by means reasonably likely to be used

    -   Converging interpretation in Sweden: pseudonymized data are still personal data to a third party

-   Sensitive personal data cannot be shared openly (requires ethics approval for processing)

    -   Definition of sensitive data concerning health is very broad

## anonymization and data sharing


-   Anonymized data can be shared fully openly

-   Non-anonymized data can be shared with controlled access

-   There are other options if you cannot anonymize the data

    -   Share summary statistics, distributions, correlation matrices, etc

## analysis scripts

-   literate programming [@knuth1984]
    -   mix analyses with text
-   R environment ([R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/))
    -   [Stefan example](https://su.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Open_data_Electrophysiological_correlates_of_in-vivo_and_virtual_reality_therapy_in_spider_phobia/14891607)
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
-   share scripts via [github](https://github.com/)
-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
